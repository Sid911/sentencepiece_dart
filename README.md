# Sentencepiece Dart

Sentencepiece Dart is a wrapper plugin for original [Sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/tree/master/src). C++ library. The plugin makes use of a little modified version of sentencepiece source which can be found [in this fork](https://github.com/Sid911/sentencepiece).

> Note : I made this plugin for my own use _(so there might be some unimplemented things)_ but open sourcing the plugin means more people can use it even with little modification.
